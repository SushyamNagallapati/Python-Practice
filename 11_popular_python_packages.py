# 2. What are API's

#   API - Application Programming Interface
#   These APIs are end points that are publicly accessible on the internet
#   We can access by URLs
#   Every http request has a method. That method determines what we are going to use this request for.
#   There are few request methods they are;
#        -> GET - for geting data
#        -> POST - for creating data
#        -> PUT - for updating data
#        -> DELETE - for deleting data

# 7. Web Scrapping

# -> Not every website has an API for us to work with.
# -> In that situation, the only way to get the data we want is to parse the html behind the webpage, get rid of all thhe html tags
#   and extract the actual data. This technique is called Web Scrapping
# -> In the video, we will learn how to scrap the questions from StackOverflow, in detail.


# 8. Browser Automation

# -> Selenium - With this we can automate our browser, so we can write a bunch of scripts to test various functions on a website.
# -> In video, Mosh taught how to sign in git hub by using VSCode

# Command Query Separation Principle

# -> This principle states that our methods (or) functions should either be commands that perform an action to change the state of a system, (or)
#   queries that return an answer to the caller without changing the state (or) causing side effects

# -> So our methods should either be commands (or) queries, but not both
# -> Explains the principal using the same spreadsheet as example
